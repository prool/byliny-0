This script will purge your playerfile, and then delete the object files
of all players not in the playerfile.  A log of all deleted players, and
the reason for their deletion, will be kept in lib/etc/DELETED.  If you
would like to adjust the allowable idle times before players are deleted,
edit src/util/purgeplay.c and recompile it.

***************************************************************************
Note, you should NEVER run this script while the MUD is running.  Also, you
may wish to make a backup of your playerfile and/or object files before
purging them.

Press return to continue with the purge, Ctrl-C to quit...
